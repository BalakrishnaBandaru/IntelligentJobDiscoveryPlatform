## 📍 Current phase

**Phase 4 — Candidate profile — DONE (2026-07-27).** Verified end-to-end against
the running stack. Next up: **Phase 5 — Rule engine + LLM explanations**, the
most important phase.

---

## ✅ Phases completed

- [x] **Phase 0 — Setup / Docker scaffold** — **DONE (2026-07-22).**
  `docker compose up --build` brings up Postgres 18 + Adminer + app; health = UP
  with DB connected. Fully containerised, no host installs.
- [x] **Phase 1 — Fetch jobs (Adzuna)** — **DONE (2026-07-22).**
  Adzuna fetch → map → persist confirmed; `max_days_old=30` + `sort_by=date`
  recency fix applied; manual click-through of applyUrls passed (real live jobs).
- [x] **Phase 2 — Add More Sources + Deduplication** — **DONE (2026-07-23).**
  Jooble active (India fallback); Arbeitnow integrated but disabled; content-hash
  dedup confirmed (re-run saves 0); `V2` migration; `POST /api/fetch` orchestrates
  active sources with per-source counts. User confirmed.
- [x] **Phase 3 — Scheduler** — **DONE (2026-07-23).**
  `@EnableScheduling` + daily cron (06:00 IST, configurable via
  `FETCH_SCHEDULE_*` / `FETCH_KEYWORDS` / `FETCH_LOCATION`); logs
  new-jobs-per-run with a per-source breakdown and applies dedup. Verified firing
  under a fast test cron, and confirmed still registered on the 2026-07-27 boot.
- [x] **Phase 4 — Candidate profile** — **DONE (2026-07-27).** See below.
- [ ] Phase 5 — Rule engine + LLM explanations *(most important)*
- [ ] Phase 6 — Telegram notifications
- [ ] Phase 7 — Application tracking
- [ ] Phase 8 — Demo polish (Docker/Adminer already done; Swagger, README, screenshots)

### Phase 4 verification (2026-07-27)

Code was written 2026-07-25 but the session ended before it was run or
committed. Verified on 2026-07-27 against a fresh container rebuild:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Gradle build in container | ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| Flyway `V3` migration | ✅ Applied; schema at v3 |
| App boot | ✅ Started 14.6s, healthy, no exceptions |
| `GET /api/profile` (unset) | ✅ 404 `profile_not_found` |
| `POST /api/profile` | ✅ 200, all fields persisted |
| `GET /api/profile` | ✅ 200, all four collections returned |
| `POST` again (upsert) | ✅ id/createdAt preserved, updatedAt bumped |
| Trim + dedupe of list values | ✅ `["  Java  ","Java","Kafka",""]` → `["Java","Kafka"]` |
| Bean validation (2 payloads) | ✅ 400 with per-field messages |
| `DELETE` | ✅ 204; child rows cascaded to 0 |
| Regression: health / jobs/count / scheduler | ✅ UP / 57 jobs / cron registered |

**Resolved risk:** four `EAGER` `@ElementCollection` bags on one entity did *not*
trigger `MultipleBagFetchException` — Hibernate 6 loads them via separate
selects, and `GET` works cleanly with `open-in-view=false`. No change needed.

## 🧭 Key decisions

- **Everything runs in Docker** — no host JDK/Postgres. Postgres 18 + Adminer +
  app all containerised. (Docker pulled up from Phase 8 to Phase 0.)
- **Java 21 + Spring Boot 4.1.0** (latest stable, locked in over the original
  "3.x"). Gradle 9.5.1 via wrapper.
  - _SB4 gotchas hit:_ use per-tech starters (`spring-boot-starter-flyway`, not
    `flyway-core`); `RestClient.Builder` isn't auto-configured — use static
    `RestClient.builder()`.
- **PostgreSQL, not H2.**
- **Flyway migrations + `ddl-auto: none`** — schema versioned/explicit (V1 = table,
  V2 = content_hash + unique index, V3 = candidate profile + 4 child tables).
- **De-dup by content-hash** of normalised `(title|company|location)`, NOT by
  apply URL (URLs differ across sources / carry volatile tracking params). Unique
  index `ux_job_listing_content_hash`. Catches re-fetches AND cross-source dupes.
- **Per-source location handling** — Jooble uses a configurable fallback location
  (default "India") because it can't geocode Indian cities (see Known issues).
- **Profile is a singleton** — single-user tool, so `POST /api/profile` upserts
  the lowest-id row. The table still carries a surrogate id so it extends to
  multiple named profiles later without a schema change.
- **Profile list fields use `@ElementCollection` child tables**, not comma-joined
  columns — keeps them queryable and portable for Phase 5 scoring.
- **Real profile data stays out of git** — `my-profile.json` is git-ignored;
  `sample-profile.json` is the committed placeholder example. Salary expectation
  and notice period must never be committed.
- **Hybrid scoring (Phase 5):** deterministic rule engine produces the score; the
  LLM only *explains* it — never invents its own number.
- **Terminology:** "automation pipeline with AI-assisted scoring", NOT an "AI agent".
- **Target profile:** Java backend, Bangalore / India.
- **Git identity** — this repo has a **local** `user.name` / `user.email` in
  `.git/config` pointing at the personal account
  (`Balakrishna Bandaru <balakrishnab7@gmail.com>`). The global `.gitconfig` is a
  work identity; do not let it leak in. All 25 pre-Phase-4 commits were rewritten
  on 2026-07-27 to the personal identity (dates and content preserved).

## ⚠️ Known issues / flagged, not yet fixed

- **Seniority mismatch (new, affects Phase 5).** The candidate has **10 years**
  of experience, but the scheduler fetches on `FETCH_KEYWORDS="java developer"`,
  which surfaces many 2–5 year roles. Phase 5 scoring should weight seniority,
  and the fetch keywords likely need widening (senior / lead / staff).
- **Arbeitnow disabled** (resolved). Verified its API supports no keyword/location
  filtering (only pagination + `visa_sponsorship`). Disabled via
  `arbeitnow.enabled=false`; client code kept + documented for a possible future
  European search. Re-enable with `ARBEITNOW_ENABLED=true`.
- **Jooble can't geocode Indian cities** — `Bangalore`/`Bengaluru`/`Mumbai` → 0
  results; only the country `India` matches. We fall back to `India`, so Jooble
  results are India-wide (Java-relevant, e.g. Mastercard roles), not
  Bangalore-specific. Configurable via `JOOBLE_FALLBACK_LOCATION`.
- **Messy source text** — e.g. Adzuna "Corp" company, quoted titles. Stored as-is.
  Needs a normalisation/cleanup pass **before Phase 5 scoring**.
- **No HTML sanitisation** of `description` (Adzuna/Arbeitnow may contain HTML).
  Revisit before Phase 5/6.
- **No automated test for the profile endpoints** — the Phase 4 lifecycle was
  verified manually via curl. `src/test` still only holds the default
  context-load test. Worth adding an integration test.
- **Cosmetic:** `expectedSalary` echoes as `4000000` on POST but `4000000.00` on
  GET (DB `numeric(12,2)` scale). Harmless; set the scale in the entity setter if
  consistent JSON is wanted.

## ▶️ Immediate next step (do this when you return)

Start **Phase 5 — Rule engine + LLM explanations** (the most important phase):

1. **Deterministic rule engine first.** Score each `JobListing` against the
   `CandidateProfile` — skill overlap, location match, seniority/experience fit,
   keyword hits, salary when present. The score is produced by code, not the LLM.
2. **Then the LLM explanation layer.** Feed the top-N shortlist plus the computed
   score to an LLM and have it *explain* the match in a sentence or two. It must
   never produce or adjust the number.
3. **Decide the LLM provider** (Spring AI vs direct REST) and add the key to
   `.env` — currently unconfigured.
4. Consider the **text-normalisation pass** (see Known issues) before scoring, so
   messy company/title text doesn't skew matches.

**Deferred idea — resume upload (discussed 2026-07-27).** Extract the profile
from an uploaded PDF/DOCX (Apache PDFBox + Apache POI). Agreed to defer until
*after* Phase 5 so it can reuse the Phase 5 LLM client for extraction rather than
brittle regex. Design agreed: **additive, not a replacement** — upload returns a
*draft* profile for review, and the existing JSON `POST /api/profile` still does
the saving. Note a resume only reliably supplies `skills`, `experienceYears` and
`keywords`; `preferredCompanies` / `preferredLocations` / `expectedSalary` /
`noticePeriodDays` are *preferences* a resume cannot provide (and past employers
must not be mistaken for preferred ones).

Useful endpoints: `POST /api/fetch?keywords=&location=` (all sources),
`POST /api/adzuna/import`, `GET /api/adzuna/search` (raw), `GET /api/jobs[?source=]`,
`GET /api/jobs/count`, `POST|GET|DELETE /api/profile`.

## 🔑 API keys / config status

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Adzuna** | ✅ working | App ID + Key in `.env`; live fetch confirmed |
| **Jooble** | ✅ working | Key in `.env`; returns India-wide results (city fallback) |
| **Arbeitnow** | ⏸️ disabled | Integrated but off (`arbeitnow.enabled=false`); no useful filtering for this search |
| **LLM API** (Phase 5) | ❌ not configured | Provider TBD (Spring AI vs direct REST) |
| **Telegram bot** (Phase 6) | ❌ not created | Create via BotFather at Phase 6 |
